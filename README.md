Unsupervised learning K-means
Predicition using K_means clustering. ML_Model_for_Clustering_using_K-means_clustering Author: Abhishek Dubey Date: 18/12/2020 I have built a simple clustering model using the "Iris.csv" data set for classifying species based upon number of parameters. This project is organized as follows: (a) importing of libraries; (b) importing the dataset; (c) Getting information about the dataset i.e. Checking of Missing values/Outliers; (d) Basic EDA and finding out number of clusters required ; (e) basic K-means clustering model; (f) model validation. 
Iris: file for the dataset used for model building. 
Task 2.ipynb: the jupyter notebook containing code.
